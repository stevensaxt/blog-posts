For my serial question, I would like to explore all of the deaths in
Alexandria that occurred during the year 1905. Once I have collected
all of the articles and blurbs that mention deaths in the Egyptian
Gazette, I will conduct further analysis by assigning specific locations
to those deaths that provide such information. Then, I will be able to 
use these locations to create a map of deaths throughout the city. In
order to ensure a comprehensive analysis, if not enough deaths are tagged
with a specific location, I will also create a pie chart showing the 
distribution of cause of death. If enough locations are tagged in the
paper, I will color code the causes of death before plotting them on the
map, which should help to give a general overview of which causes of
death are relevant in certain parts of the city, or if any correlation
exists at all.

This is an important analysis to conduct because it should hopefully
shed some light on the reasons for death, ages of death, and locations
of death throughout Alexandria. By delving into this topic, I hope to
answer the question "How did people die in Alexandria in 1905?" and draw
parallels to the causes of death now and how the two differ.
