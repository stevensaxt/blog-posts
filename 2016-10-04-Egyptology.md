[Egyptology](https://www.britannica.com/science/Egyptology) has caputured pop-culture imagination owing to movies like _The Mummy_, and exhibits like King Tut.  Films often emphasize the mysticism, magic, or exoticism of Egyptian artefacts and Tombs.  The Egyptian Gazette, however, provides a closer perspective, both in time and location.

While the excavation and discovery of these tombs has historical significance on a global scale, the local perspective brings the actual characters that advanced the discovery of these relics to light.  The [newspaper](https://github.com/Lionex/dig-eg-gaz/blob/7dbde112756552ed412ee7145eb84208ffe34fd4/ocr/1905-10-06-p3.txt#L88) serves as a medium for criticism and discourse, which time and distance have buried.

This liveliness caught me off guard, and reminds me that the study of history always lives and breaths, not confined to memory or buried between the covers of a textbook.
