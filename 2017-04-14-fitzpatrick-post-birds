I came across a morbidly funny article when reading through my week of the Egyptian Gazette. The title,
"FATE OF 6,000 BIRDS" and to summarize the article briefly, after two nights of thick fog, nearly 6,000
birds were found dead under a lighthouse. They were attracted to the light in the fog and flew right
against it. Not much else is mentioned in the article, it is a rather brief memorial. This struck me
as being a unique article so I decided to share it. I did a quick search on the location of the lighthouse,
"Cape Grisnez" and turns out this story takes place in France! Cape Grisnez is in northern France between
Wissant and Audresselles. The cape held place to a naval battle during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805, and
also would play a historical role in World War II. The lighthouse was built in 1837, originally standing
46 feet tall. In 1861, the lighthouse was raised to 79 feet tall. Reading articles from the past makes the
research more interesting, you read it from the perspective of the time frame it was written, but when
investigating further you get a full picture that spans past the newspaper and through to present day.
It just struck me funny how such a odd story could make international news, though granted the Egyptian
Gazette was sold to an audience of mainly Europeans.
