As I was going through and correcting the text of the Egyptian Gazette from 1905, I noticed that the paper gives lists of names of people who attended certain events, or who embarked on a ship, every week.  This sparked my mind, making me think how close this community was.  Are the names on these lists just the highly recognized citizens, or is it a mix of everyone in the community.  The events that they list names for include, but are not limited to, arrivals, departures, visitors lists, guests at restaurants, dances, and even concerts.  These records of who attended are quite lengthy, which makes me lean more towards the thought that these lists are just a mix of everyone in the community, meaning that they, in fact, are a very close knit group of people.
