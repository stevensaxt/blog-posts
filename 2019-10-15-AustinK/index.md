I was looking through my papers and noticed an interesting article that didn't seem to align with the theme of the local newsletter. In the _Egyptian Gazette_, mostly everything is generalized and for the benefit of the reader but there was a section titled *[Obituary]*(https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-02-17-0202160131-story.html) and it was interesting because it was on one specific person. As I read I realized that even though she did just seem like another local, the point of the article was to show how *[every citizen is important]*(http://www.globalthinkersforum.org/our-impact/each-and-everyone-of-us-is-unique-and-important-and-no-one-is-insignificant/) and it made sure to explain how she was a quality person and her death was to be mourned as many of the locals in Luxor and Cairo cared for her.
>“Each and Everyone of Us Is Unique and Important, and No-one Is Insignificant”

I find this fascinating because there are two other instances I found while browsing through the blog posts in which the _Egyptian Gazette_ has done this.
For example:  
1. [In the death of Haicalis Pasha](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-23-baenen-deathofthepasha/)
2. [Death of Mr. Hanna](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-fitzpatrick/)
In both instances the newsletter is reporting local deaths and it shows that the community do care about its people and that no passing is meaningless.

One of the important things that was pointed out in the Obituary is how Miss Collins spent a majority of her time at church and actually passed while at a Sunday Service. It is safe to assume that she is now in [Heaven](https://www.everystudent.com/journeys/then.html) because not only did she realize God but also lived an honest life.
