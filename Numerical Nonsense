#Numerical Nonsense
I've encountered many problems during the course of this class.  From
my flash drive, containing all of my microfilm scans becoming corrupted to
running out of trial time on just about every application we needed.  But the one
thing that stands above all else, is translating the minuscule blurred text,
mainly numerical values included in the financial tables.  I found the OCR
converter to be quite useless, words came out a jumbled mess and often
everything was out of order.  I ended up retyping many portions of the pages
manually, this was until I discovered stitching process and this made things a
bit easier for me.  From that point forward, I mainly just had problems
deciphering numbers and inputing them all from scratch into the templates.  The
numbers on the newspaper were very hard to make out especially the fractional
values, I could almost never distinguish what they were, and maybe if I had
scanned with more brightness or focus it would have helped but for the most
part, I think it was poor formatting of the newspaper itself.  I had to just gave
it my best guess for a majority of the pages.
Overall the work was very tedious and stressful at times, definitely not for the
faint of heart.  But nothing was more rewarding than successfully accomplishing
my xml files.  Being able to read them back with ease and finally enjoy some of
the bizarre stories during this time period was very enlightening and often
very funny.
