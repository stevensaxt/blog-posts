Originally, I thought that my serial question was going to focus on missing persons and examine the amount of information provided for each particular circumstance. However, as I began to try to develop a query for that topic, I had difficulty finding much data other than what I had seen in my issue. So, I began to explore new ideas. I found myself still interested in the stories concerning specific people and began to investigate random names. I eventually found that there were multiple accounts in multiple issues tracking the movement of explorers. With this, I began to wonder about the most common reasons and locations for expeditions  reported in the 1905 Egyptian Gazette. I developed a simple query to find information relating to my question by searching for items containing the word “expedition.” This brought back quite a few results. My hope is that the information gathered from these results will provide some insight into the “who, what, and why” of the expeditions reported in the paper. I also hope to discover how many of these were “successful” and what determined them to be so. I anticipate some trends in location and perhaps even in the reasons for traveling. For the final analysis, I believe that a map will be beneficial.
