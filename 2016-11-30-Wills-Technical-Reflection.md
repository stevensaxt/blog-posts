####A Technical Reflection
In the time of the **Egyptian Gazette**, and specifically the year 1905, many of the worlds 
major powers resided in Europe and Asia, while the continent of Africa was behind.  For my 
cereal question, I would like to take a look into the influence some of these major European and 
Asian powers had evident in the Egyptian newspaper.  More specifically, I would like to look into 
the results of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, how it upset Russia, and the preparedness of Egypt in 
the case of a global conflict.  Along with looking into these storylines throughout the issue, I 
would like to create an interactive map of sorts, labeling the main positions of these storylines.  
If the user was to select a point on the map, a brief explanation of the situation, along with a 
date would show up.  In my analysis I would like generally discuss Egypt’s reactions, their 
opinions on the global treaties, as well as the effects of the agreements between foreign 
nations.  I would mostly like to focus on the influence of England, and the resulting reactions of 
Russia to movements made by the English, as they would regularly lead to a series of other 
reactions.  Querying has resulted in a good amount of topics regarding Egyptian-English 
relations, as well as on the topic of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and through varying the search 
queries, plenty of data is available regarding this topic.
