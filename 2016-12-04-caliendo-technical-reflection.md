When I signed up for this course, I was quite unclear about what exactly the coursework would entail. But, the idea of translating newspaper pages to text as a way of research was intriguing to me, and it was enough of a reason to register for this abstract class. When I began my journey through this course, I immediately faced many technical problems. Foremost, learning how to scan the microfilm of the newspaper pages was somewhat challenging. It took about 30 minutes of messing around with the machine to finally figure out how to even begin to scan the pages I needed, and once I did figure this out, it seemed almost impossible to get all of the text on the page to show up clearly in the scan. Either some portions were too dark, or too light, or sometimes not even displayed on the scan. But eventually I came to terms with the imperfections, and managed to get what I thought would be workable images.

The next step of the process was to OCR the page images, and this was the most troubling step. After countless hours of trial and error with ABBYY, I decided to switch to Cisdem, and this offered somewhat of a better solution in terms of final product. However I found that it was very difficult to get the program to read the newspaper page in the correct order, so I was forced to reorder all of the scanned text in order for it to match up with the paper. Not to mention, the absolutely countless amount of textual errors that came with the OCR. As a result, I spent nearly 3 hours for each single page just correcting the text to make it perfect. Luckily, the XML process in all of this seemed like my saving grace. Although there was definitely a learning curve at first, once I got the hang of the structural tags, I was able to code all of the text quite simply, and It became more of an issue of time and tedious work.

Although my technical reflection is mostly negative, I do feel that this class enabled me to gain a set of very unique skills that I probably would have never acquired had it not been for this class.
