####As a lover of friction,
######I decided to pick a short story, named as _The Road Man_, for this assignment.######
######The story pertains to a young fellow who always noticed an **elderly prophet** that always carries ######
######a hefty wheelbarrow. I was very amused to this piece because I notice many similarities ######
######between the prophet and your average college student. For instance, when the narrator mentions,######
######“ His skin, burnt almost black with sun and wind, his shaggy eyebrows and long white beard, ######
######suggest the prophets of ancient days”, reminded me of a college senior. As the prophet######
######appears wore down from his exposure to the sun, one may compare that to how a senior######
######appears exhausted, after years of sleep deprivation due to a tedious work load. Ironically######
######, the narrator gave me the impression that he is a college freshman, because he is young ######
######and does not have the same years of experiences as to the prophet. Many college freshman######
######will not understand a college seniors’ desire to undertake a tedious take due to the ######
######lack of experience. However, as the years pass by, college freshman’s will fulfill######
######the seniors shoes, as the narrator will fill the prophet shoes. I believe this passage ######
######  is very significant since it is still relevant after being composed 115 years ago.######
