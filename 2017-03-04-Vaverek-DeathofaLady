On August 30th, 1906 at around 5 o'clock in the evening, Lady Campbell-Bannerman passed away
in Marienbad, a tourist town in the Czech Republic known for it's spas. According to a [New York
Times article](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E1DA1F3EE733A25752C3A96E9C946797D6CF) from the following day, "she had been an invalid for years". Now this sounds pretty
terrible to my inexperienced ears, but it really means that she was ill for the last few years of
her life. In modern society, where the vast majority of people in developed countries live into their
70s, 80s, and much longer, it's commonplace for people to have multiple chronic illnesses by the time
they die. I mean, everyone's grandma has arthritis. Lady Campbell-Bannerman was 74 when she died, so
it shouldn't be a surprise that she was ill and unable to entertain in her last years.

Lady Campbell-Bannerman was a cultured and refined woman, although a "plain and stout" one. She married Sir Henry
in September of 1960, and spent the entirety of their married life steering his political career from
her position as his wife. Her inability to host parties in her later years was of cultural significance; as a
young politician's wife, her parties were the talk of the town. She had a particular affinity for the French- the
couple's vacation home was strewn with French furniture and art, and she was fluent in the language and well-versed
in the literature.

The impact of his wife's death weighed heavily on the Prime Minister, and very soon after he had many successively
worsening heart attacks. Although, it should be noted that these heart attacks may have been influenced by
the considerable weight of the Prime Minister, as both he and his wife were said to weigh nearly 300 pounds
each by the end of their lives.

King Edward VII attended the funeral of Lady Campbell-Bannerman, and she was buried in a Protestant churchyard
in Marienbad.
