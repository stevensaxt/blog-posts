While reading the Egyptian Gazette, I found articles very interesting that involved tragic events. Examples of these consisted of wolf fires, murder, and interesting events such as a man attempting to throw his wife out of a window. I touched on this tragic event in my previous blog. It was mind boggling to see how many unique events occurred. I found it also crazy how many times that tragic events occurred, the people did not act as surprised as if the event occurred in today’s world. This is why  I decided to choose tragic events as my serial questions. I wanted to focus on the different forms of crime and events that occurred to see the different lifestyles. 
To search files to get relevant information, I used the //div[@type="item"][contains(., ‘insertword’)] search tool. I did so to observe different divs that included key words such as this to find tragic events. I also searched words such as murder, tragic, and death. Key words such as these allowed my search engine to find me specific tragic events that will be relevant to discuss in my topic. 
Throughout my search, to organize my results, I decided to incorporate an organize table. The table will clearly depict the different search results and the amount of related divs that were found. It includes a quick key point of the event. This will help to make my results more tangible to create an analysis of the different tragic events that will occur. 

The serial questions will allow others to observe the different tragic events that occurred in 1905 and their relevance to today’s events. It will allow me to clearly distinguish the route people took to deal with these events and whether or not it is similar to those taken today.
