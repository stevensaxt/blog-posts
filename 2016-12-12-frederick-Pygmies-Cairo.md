My serial question revolves around a culture in Africa and the treatment of and attitudes toward that culture. The African pygmies. I had several articles about this group of people over the course of my week and I began to wonder what exactly the pygmies were and how they were seen by the people of Cairo. Some problems that I foresee in the tackling of my serial question would be gathering all the information that I need to produce an analytical paper on the pygmies by using the resources available in the Egyptian Gazette alone. I might be able to find enough information about the treatment of the pygmies by other cultures (i.e. those in Egypt).  I will not, however, be able to discover much information about the culture of the pygmies itself. I will also have quite the problem querrying since, as i have mentioned in an earlier blog post, I am very inept when it comes to technology and have no clue how to querry. With tutorials available to me I am hoping that this possible roadblock will not prove to be much of a problem.
