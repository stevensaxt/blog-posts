<p>In 1905 Alexandria on my third pages I have noticed a lot of deaths being
reported in the newspaper. There was a child killed by a horse in an accident
and it received approximately 3 lines of text with little to no commentary.
When the Grand Mufti died he had almost an entire column in every single page
of the newspaper. They made updates on the family and commented on his well
being as well as his wishes for the future and memories of the past. It is
so sad to see in this paper how little the newspapers covered tragedies like
children dying and they covered an older man who had been dying for a while so
heavily. I understand having to put the Grand Mufti in the spotlight since
he was the leader of the country, however it is quite the travesty to see
people being disregarded publicly. They need to give them the respect they
deserve, or just not mention it.<p>
