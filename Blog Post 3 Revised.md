For my serial question, I plan to ask the question "What topics are discussed in the international section of the Egyptian Gazette and how do these topics differ based on location?" In order to query this, I will use an XPath command to search the datelines in the international section. All occurrences will then return for my desired city names.

The three cities I have chosen to analyze are Paris, France, London, England, and St. Petersburg, Russia. For each dateline that returns with one of those cities, I will classify the news blurb in a category and compile three pie charts- one for each city. These pie charts, when placed side-by-side, will not only provide viewers with an idea of the most frequently discussed topics and occurrences in each city, but will also provide a comparison between the cities. Viewers will be able to see which topics are most-discussed in one city and compare that topic to another. When tied in with the world events that were occurring, this should come together cohesively.

This is important research to conduct because it will hopefully shed some light onto what was most important to people and how that importance varied from city to city.
