A husband bought some hashish paste, which, after some research, is a recreational drug that has the same active ingredients as marijuana. he had a dose and made the mistake of giving his wife the rest. After she kept tasting it, she saw a fire and began to scream. Her husband rushed towards her and called the police because of the huge fire they saw. When the police arrived, there was no fire and the couple thought that a small roof lamp was the huge fire. I am curious as to whether the couple got punished for taking any form of marijuana and what any other effects happened because of the event. Did friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers make fun of them for such an event? How is marijuana use seen in society back then? Also, was marijuana common or illegal back then. Were laws on drugs strict back then? Another thing I am curious about is just how much did they take to somehow imagine a fire from a lamp. Was their event used as an example against drug use? Of course this event managed to make it into the newspaper so does that mean that it became viral over the town.
