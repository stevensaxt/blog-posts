The cousin of H.H. the Khedive, Prince Mohamid Ibrahim, was killed along with
his driver in a rather unusual car accident. The accident report stated that
his driver was speeding, and collided with a train. It is incredibly rare to
 see train/car collisions spurring from speeding as opposed to a car
 stopped on the tracks. This incident makes me wonder what exactly was going on.
 Was a matter of sheer stupidity on account of the driver? Did he think he could
 outrun a train, or make it past the tracks before it got there? Was the Prince
 in a rush to be somewhere? It was on a Saturday night so maybe the driver had
 a little too much of that Hashish. It is baffling that out of all the things he
 could have collided with it was a train. In order to be a fatal crash, he had to
 have most likely come in to contact with the front of the train. This was not even
 his first car accident. He was also involved in a car accident a year earlier.
 After the first crash, the Prince probably should have taken the hint that his
 driver was not very skilled at his profession.
