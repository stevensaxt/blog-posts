#Technical and Time Issues
To be honest, this class is not what I expected it to be. I did not expect
to be learning how to code things or doing xml or anything that involved
technical skills. While learning the skills is not difficult, it is
difficult to find the time it takes to complete the assignments.
I try to set aside time to complete pages and to edit the text,
however I can never find enough time. For me, this is a huge issue
because I am super obsessive about my grades and I am actually
concerned about not receiving a good grade in this class. I do not face
any technical issues, just time issues. Thus far I have completed the first
three pages of everyday , the only issue in the pages that I find is not
being able to read the data for financial tables. The data is always written
very small and it tends to be smuged and **I hate it and it gives me a headache.**
