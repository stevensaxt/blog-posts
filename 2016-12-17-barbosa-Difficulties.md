My difficulties began with Cisdem, the program that turned the images into text files. I couldn’t find a way to order them so everything was out of order with my first text file and it wasted a lot of my time. What I tried doing to solve this was to register the image by entire columns and it would be in order but since the image wasn’t completely straight, I would get letters from other columns at the edges of the column I would focus on. Fixing the errors made by the program was also very time consuming. Even when I was getting the hang and flow of things I would spend hours on a single image. I was discouraged to keep working as a result of this tedious work but I tried to keep going to not fail the class. Thankfully I had no problem with xml and it was a very fast program to use. Even with that part of the process being fast, it still took a long time to get through each page. I had no problem getting the images from library. Each image went by pretty quickly and they turned out fine from my first try. Overall, the biggest issue was fixing the text files but other than that, the class wasn’t hard in terms of managing the different programs.
