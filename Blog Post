On October 16, 1906 there have been multiple reports if incidents of the Bubonique Plague and Typhoid Fever. Citizens are dying at an alarming rate and there has reportedly been an outbreak on a steamship that was set to sail to Ras-el-Tin. A first class domestic man by the name of R. Cole sailing on H.M.S Venus was suffering from symptoms of "interior fever" and was rushed to the hospital immediately after disembarking the ship. Mr. Cole tragically succumbed to his illness at 2.45am on October 16.
A second case of typhoid fever occurred on board the Venus since her arrival of Egyptian waters. The first person to experience symptoms was Captain Eyre, who has since been rushed to a hospital in Port Said.
The week prior to October 15, there have been a report of 6 cases of the Bubonique Plague throughout the country of Egypt,  3  cases at Alexandria, 2 at Suez, and one in the Minieh district. This is alarming as 492 cases have been reported since the start of the year, and this is a large increase from the previous year of 1905 where 264 incidents had been reported.
