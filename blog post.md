# Dead Hungry
We are all going to die.  I am so sorry I had to be the one to break the news, but someone had to. Have you ever thought about your funeral? How you want to die? Or if you want to be buried alone? What if I told you no one in Ancient Egypt was buried alone? Well I am telling you that and it is true. But in Egypt your death is just as important as your life so one should be prepared for it. W. St Chad Boscawen found that ancient Egyptians were buried with food. Yay, you won’t spend eternity hungry! Dr. Wanda K. Farr, of the Research Laboratories of the Celanese Corporation of America, told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “BREAD from the funeral feasts that were put into the tombs with ancient Egypt's mummified dead is still bread, with starch and protein grains still in good chemical condition” (Food For Egyptian Mummies) This food was found in vases or food dishes and there is a fine collection of food from vegetable matter to bread, fish or even fresh water crustacean. In a research paper by Braustein called The Meaning of Egyptian-Style Objects in the Late Bronze Cemeteries of Tell el-Far’ah said that “5% of Gurob burials and 3% of Far’ah burials had food or sealed vessels” (Braustein). I know what you are thinking, what if you get thirsty? Have no fear if you are lucky enough in “the temeros” where your body is placed there is a round hole in the middle that contains a drain where offering of beer or wine could be made. Is it easier now to accept the inevitable? At least you won’t be hungry.
