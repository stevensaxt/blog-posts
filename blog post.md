For the blog post I chose an article titled “Cairo Visitor Gravely Injured”
 from page 3 of the Thursday December 1906 issue. The article talks about an
  accident that occurred on the P. and O. express the Friday before where two
   passengers were injured, and I believe one of them died? Its not very clear
    and is not actually stated but, is implied.

The two passengers injured were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanna, who were visiting
 from Dublin. Mrs. Hanna was not seriously injured but it seems that Mr. Hanna
  was killed. The suspected death was caused by a piece of metal that crashed
  through the window. Apparently, they’re not sure how it really happened,
  either from a bridge or a part of the train which doesn’t really make sense
  because I would think if it came from the bridge it would cause more external
   damage versus internal like the part of the train would cause making it
   easier to pinpoint the cause.

This leads me to question just how in-depth incidents were investigated in
 Egypt at this time. Did they just quickly glance at the scene and decide on
 the circumstances surrounding it, or did they thoroughly investigate and try
 to find the actual cause. Interestingly enough there is a similar article that
   was found in The London Times that follows up on the accident and says that
 Mr. Hanna was severely injured in the accident and died the next morning at
  the hospital. It gives a little bit more information about him saying he was
  42 years old and was an engineer on an Indian Railway. It also says how his
  wife Mrs. Hannas condition has improved. While there isn't a happy ending,
  at least we are able to find a little bit more information on the situation.
