For my serial question, I will be examining the trends in cotton exports to different countries using the monthly “Coton” table included in the financial section of the Egyptian Gazette. Specifically, I will be looking to see whether there are any variations in export volume (measured in bales) due to changes in season, significant domestic and international historical events, or any other major influences of demand. Particularly, this serial question gives me the unique opportunity to examine how complex international relationships at the turn of the century between Great Britain and other states might have trickled down to affect more localized factors, such as cotton exportation from one of its most valued colonies. I believe this questions reflects the spirit of one of the principal goals of this course.
