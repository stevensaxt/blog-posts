![The Baltic Fleet](The Baltic Fleet.png)
My serial discovery is that of reported military naval movements, particularly the movements of the Russian and Japanese fleets as a result of the [Russo-Japanse War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War). My goal is to use key words such as: "navy, battle, combat, fleet, ship, military, Nebogatoff, Tago and Rodjestvensky", to find entries in the year of 1905. After finding as many entries as possible from the Egyptian Gazette, I will put together a spreadsheet that lists the report type (civilian or official), date, location and affiliation of each fleet. 

Hopefully, there will be additional information like the admiral(s) present with each fleet, the number, names and types of ships and any losses if a battle has occured. Any information that is lacking in the newspaper can hopefully be supplemented by [outside historical records](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/russian-fleet-surrenders-at-port-arthur). After collecting and organizing the data, I plan on using Google maps to plot the location and movements of the fleets, which will then be tagged with all of the non-locational data. That way, there will be a spiderweb across a map of the oceans linking points that can be clicked on for all available information on what happened there.
