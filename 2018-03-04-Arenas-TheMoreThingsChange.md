# The More Things Change
### The more they stay the same

There is nothing new about racism or xenophobia, and it should be unsurprising, even expected to find examples of orientalism in an [imperial newspaper](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/British-Imperialism/) aimed at colonial agents. What is surprising, and as an immigrant, more than a little upsetting, was reading a quoted article from "Home Counties Magasine" bemoaning the supposed death of the neighborhood of Whitechapel in East-end. The language used is frightfully familiar. "Extreme poverty is perhaps the most striking characteristic of this community..." The unnamed writer goes on to describe just how "the typical alien in his English career" establishes himself. He finds a cheap room where he sleeps with his entire family and where he "plies his trade." Expanding his business he recruits fellow immigrants, and they "dexterously avoid the eye of the law." Ultimately, this faceless alien creates and propagates a nasty system of poverty, crime, and misery

This viciously dehumanizing view of immigrants stands in bewildering contrast to other articles the Egyptian Gazette publishes observing native Egyptians daily. There is almost a [respect](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/abduh/) given to some members of the muslim community and in the next day there is an article welcoming the construction of a Mosque in London!

It seems that Great Britain had a [history](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24427043?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=edwardian&searchText=racism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Facc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3Dedwardian%2Bracism%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&refreqid=search%3A755db30b4d0fb767b2f49b3c6b757e39&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) of anti-semitism in this era that also saw the Dreyfus affair and the proliferation of biological racism that further dehumanized non-white groups. I can only hazard a guess as to why such a heinously racist view of jewish immigrants in Whitechapel can coexist with the apparent celebration of muslim culture. The closest I can understand is the idea of ["defensive imperialism"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25691223?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=edwardian&searchText=racism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Facc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3Dedwardian%2Bracism%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&refreqid=search%3A755db30b4d0fb767b2f49b3c6b757e39&seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents). As subjects of British rule, muslim Egyptians are "ok" so long as they stay in their seperate sphere, but the whole point of empire, other than enrichment, is to protect the colonial nation from the subjects of _other_ empires when they "invade" (I cannot stress the quotation marks there enough) home. It turns the idea of Empire on its head.
