![Wife Murder](Wife Murder.png)

*On the twenty-fourth inst. of January,* an incident involving a woman and her enraged husband occurred. The man killed his wife by hitting her on the head using a metal bar made of iron and fled the scene. **The former clerk from Gabbari has yet to be discovered.**
The motive for committing this heinous crime is unknown. Perhaps his wife was cheating on him or maybe she cooked him a poor meal. I find it interesting that an event of this magnitude is not given a bigger article. Someone's life has been ended and there is a posibility that others may be in danger. More information should be provided and this news story should not be shrugged off as an every day occurrence Either way, the suspect is still at large and he needs to be caught before he spreads his mayhem elsewhere.
