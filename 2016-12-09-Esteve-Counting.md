As I began thinking about what type of serial question I was interested in, I initially began focusing on advertisements. Specifically, I wanted to count the number of ads in the newspaper and make a graph using my results. However, as I began using different queries, I realized that just counting advertisements was not really interesting. Because of this, I began counting other things. I started manipulating my queries in order to count in different ways. At the moment, I can count specific words throughout the paper. I can count divs, heads, and paragraphs. As I focus on this serial question, I will find different queries for counting. I wish to explore how counting in XPath queries can reveal different types of information in the newspaper. I plan on using counting queries to manipulate information in the newspaper and then coming up with conclusions based on those queries. This will also be a great tool for current and future students to better understand counting in Oxygen.  
    
In addition to counting things, I will make a series of graphs to go along with my queries. Obviously, everyone in the class is at different stages of completing their weeks. Because of this, I will find a way to somewhat determine how reliable everyone's data is. The completion of Page One can be found by looking at the number of divs. For my purposes, I want a better overall picture. If I can find a way to count words or paragraphs, I will be much happier with the results. With that goal in mind, I have been playing with string queries. If I can find a way to see which weeks are more accurate, I can make some solid conclusions based on the data that I find.
