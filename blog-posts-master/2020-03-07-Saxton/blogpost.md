title: "Lord Cromer Reigns Supreme"
subtitle: "The Lack of Journalistic Impartiality in Early 20th-Century Egypt." 
summary: "In this blog post, I will explore the nonexistence of bias in the Egyptian Gazette, particulalrly regarding the Moore Case. From a piece of Lord Cromer's report in the April 4th, 1907 edition of the Egyptian Gazette, it appears as though a higher-up official for the Egyptian Gazette
(the aforementioned Mr. Moore.) was involved in a legal dispute with three other local newspapers, all owned and represented by Egyptians. This creates a bias issue that is clearly seen in the way the article is written, and is not something that would be seen in a newspaper nowadays."

The major news publications of today pride themselves on impartiality, fairness, and their nature to reject bias in every form. Not only are they held to the 
idea of journalistic integrity, but also laws that govern what they can and cannot print. In early 1900s Egypt, no such requirements existed. Because of this, 
there could be many accounts of an event or happening, each with varying levels of accuracy. With little regulation, anyone who wanted to publish a newspaper could,
and this led to the creation of hundreds of newspapers in a very short amount of time at the beginning of the century. Those that did well had stronger funding and 
better distribution ability, like _The Egyptian Gazette_. Newspapers with lower numbers of readers and fewer means of production and distribution, like 
[this newspaper](https://heritage.bnf.fr/bibliothequesorient/en/egyptienne-magazine-art), had a much tougher time finding an audience. With a large readership and 
significant funding, _The Egyptian Gazette_ quickly became a mouthpiece for english-speaking residents of Alexandria, and communicated local events as well as the
events back in Great Britain. The cultural divides at the time were in no way shape or form close to mending, and the lack of a moral expectation allowed things 
published in the paper to be as racially biased as they wanted, even without explicit slurs or callouts. When undetected, this proved dangerous, and turned the 
publication into something resembling propaganda. They knew that readers would get used to this style, which is why they felt comfortable publishing an excerpt in
Lord Cromer's Report detailing the legal fight one of their executives was having with other newspapers in the city, vehemently defending him and using language 
that no one reading would assume to be unbiased or impartial.
